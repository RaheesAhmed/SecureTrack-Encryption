# Prepare SecureTrack Crypto Library for Open Source Release

This PR prepares the SecureTrack Crypto Library for open-source release by:

1. **Replacing custom Shamir's Secret Sharing implementation with the `sharks` crate**

   - More secure implementation backed by a dedicated library
   - Maintains the same API for backwards compatibility
   - Better tested and maintained than our custom implementation

2. **Adding comprehensive documentation**

   - README.md with examples for both Rust and WASM contexts
   - Detailed build instructions for WASM
   - Clear code documentation with security considerations

3. **Adding CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines**
   - Instructions for setting up the development environment
   - Guidelines for code style, testing, and documentation
   - Process for reporting security vulnerabilities
   - Clear expectations for pull requests

## Security Improvements

- Eliminated potential vulnerabilities in the custom Shamir's Secret Sharing implementation
- Added explicit security considerations to all documentation
- Established a secure process for vulnerability reporting

## Testing

All changes have been tested with:

- `cargo test` for native Rust
- `cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` for WASM
- `wasm-bindgen` build verification

## Next Steps for Open Source Release

1. Set up GitHub Actions CI for automated testing
2. Create issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
3. Add SECURITY.md policy for responsible disclosure
4. Create a detailed CHANGELOG.md
5. Set up GitHub repository settings (branch protection, etc.)

## Note on Example Code

All example code in the documentation has been verified to work with the current API. The TypeScript example specifically addresses common pitfalls when working with the WASM bindings.
