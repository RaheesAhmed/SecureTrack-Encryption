  - [ ] Verify XOR-based sharing mathematical correctness
  - [ ] Check share serialization format for potential vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Confirm all shares are required for reconstruction

## Memory Safety

  - [ ] Validate against compiler optimizations removing security operations

- [ ] **Protection Against Side-Channel Attacks**
  - [ ] Verify constant-time operations for sensitive comparisons
  - [ ] Check for potential cache timing vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Review memory access patterns for potential leaks

## Error Handling

- [ ] **Error Information Leakage**

  - [ ] Verify errors don't reveal cryptographic material
  - [ ] Check for potential timing differences in error paths
  - [ ] Confirm error codes are sufficiently generic to not leak implementation details

- [ ] **WASM Error Propagation**
  - [ ] Verify WASM errors are properly structured
  - [ ] Check for potential information leakage in JavaScript error objects

## Randomness

- [ ] **Entropy Sources**
  - [ ] Verify CSPRNG is used for all random operations
  - [ ] Confirm getrandom crate is properly configured for WASM
  - [ ] Check for proper fallbacks if system entropy is unavailable

## Input Validation

- [ ] **Parameter Validation**
  - [ ] Verify all public functions validate their inputs
  - [ ] Check for potential integer overflows in length calculations
  - [ ] Confirm proper validation of serialized formats

## WASM-Specific Security

- [ ] **WASM Memory Model**

  - [ ] Verify sensitive data is properly cleaned from WASM linear memory
  - [ ] Check for potential data leakage between WASM and JS
  - [ ] Confirm WebAssembly memory isolation is maintained

- [ ] **JavaScript Interface**
  - [ ] Verify proper type conversions between Rust and JavaScript
  - [ ] Check for potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities
  - [ ] Confirm JavaScript interop doesn't introduce timing vulnerabilities

## Documentation

- [ ] **Security Documentation**
  - [ ] Verify all security assumptions are clearly documented
  - [ ] Check that configuration options have security implications explained
  - [ ] Confirm proper usage patterns are demonstrated in examples

## Compatibility

- [ ] **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
  - [ ] Verify library functions correctly on all target platforms
  - [ ] Check for platform-specific cryptographic differences
  - [ ] Confirm WASM compatibility across browsers

## Testing

- [ ] **Test Coverage**

  - [ ] Verify 90%+ code coverage by unit tests
  - [ ] Check for edge case testing (empty inputs, large inputs, etc.)
  - [ ] Confirm negative test cases for error conditions

- [ ] **Known Answer Tests**
  - [ ] Verify cryptographic operations match known test vectors
  - [ ] Check for regression tests of fixed vulnerabilities

## Third-Party Dependencies

- [ ] **Dependency Audit**
  - [ ] Verify all dependencies are up-to-date
  - [ ] Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
  - [ ] Confirm minimal set of dependencies is used
  - [ ] Run `cargo audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies

## Fuzzing

- [ ] **Fuzz Testing**
